  "Options for automatic export of references extracted by Refuse.
This variable is an association list of the form
\(TYPE . ((TARGET LOCATION PROPERTIES))).

TYPE is the type of the exported data, one of the symbols `txt',
`bib' or `org'.  The data will only be exported if its
corresponding symbol is present on the list.

TARGET must be one of the symbols `heading' or `path'.  The
symbol `heading' means export the data under a heading in the
buffer of origin, the Org-mode buffer where the Refuse
process was started.  The symbol `path' means export the data to
another file.  It is possible to specify both export targets
simultaneously for a given export TYPE or multiple targets of the
same type.

Example:
\(setq refuse-export-options
      '((org (heading HEADLINE PROPERTIES)
             (path LOCATION PROPERTIES))))

LOCATION (HEADLINE) is a string specifying location of the TARGET.

- If TARGET is `heading', the supplied string will be used as
headline text.  The data will be exported slightly differently
depending on TYPE.  Text references will be exported as is.
BibTeX references will be put into an Org-mode source code block.
Org-mode references, if grouped under different headings, will be
exported with the headings demoted by one level.

- If TARGET is `path', the supplied string will be used as a
filesystem target.  The path can be absolute or relative, in the
latter case it will be relative to the directory of the buffer of
origin.  If the path (absolute or relative) is an *existing*
directory, the full path to the target file will be constructed
from the supplied string as a directory name, the #+ROAM_KEY:
property in the buffer of origin as a file name and TYPE as the
file's extension.  If the path is not an existing directory, it
will be treated as a file name, and the data will be exported
there.  The file will be created if it does not exist:

> \"~/org/references.org\"           - absolute path
> \"this-note's-bib-references.bib\" - path relative to the buffer of origin
> \"~/refuse-references/\" - absolute directory path.

In the latter case, if the directory exists, the extracted data
will be put into a file \"Doe2020.bib\", assuming the #+ROAM_KEY:
property is \"Doe2020\" and TYPE is `bib'.  If the directory does
not exist, the extracted data will be put into a (newly created)
file \"~/refuse-references/\".

Example:
\(setq refuse-export-options
      '((org (heading \"Org references\" PROPERTIES))
        (txt (path \"text-references/\" PROPERTIES))))

PROPERTIES is a property list providing additional export
specifications.  Some properties are specific to only certain
export TYPEs or TARGETs.

`:placement' property allows to specify placement of the exported
data.  It can be a symbol `prepend' or `append'.

When TARGET is `path', text data is simply put at the beginning
or end of the target file accordingly to the value of the
`:placement' property.  Org-mode data is placed before the first
or after the last heading, respectively.  Similarly, BibTeX data
is placed or before the first or after the last entry, comments
and @String entries ignored.

When TARGET is `heading', this property specifies whether the
parent heading should be put before or after other headings.

When TARGET is `path' and LOCATION is an Org-mode file, the value
of the `:placement' property can also be a list of the form
\(heading HEADLINE PROPERTIES).  In this case the data will be
put in the target file under a heading with HEADLINE as the
headline text.  PROPERTIES are additional export options as
described here and below.  The `heading' value of the
`:placement' property cannot be used recursively in this case.

Example:
\(setq refuse-export-options
      '((org (path \"references.org\" :placement append))
        (bib (path \"references.bib\" :placement prepend))
        (txt (path \"references.txt\"
                   :placement (headline \"References\" :placement append)))))

If placement is not specified, the data is appended by default.

`:property-drawer' property allows to supply a heading with some
properties.  The value of this property is list with
elements (PROPERTY_NAME . PROPERTY_VALUE) or PROPERTY_NAME, the
latter form being treated as (PROPERTY_NAME . nil).

PROPERTY_NAME must be a string, it will be used as a property
name.  PROPERY_VALUE can be a string, in which case it will be
used as the value of the property.  It can also be a function
name as an unquoted symbol, in which case this function will be
called to get the value of the property.  The return value must
be a string.

The following properties are recognized internally and will be
supplied with automatically generated values if PROPERTY_VALUE is
nil:

> REFUSE_TYPE   - TYPE of the export data
> REFUSE_SOURCE - name of the PDF file the data were extracted from
> REFUSE_DATE   - time and date the data were exported

Example:
\(setq refuse-export-options
      '((org (heading \"Org references\" PROPERTIES)))
        (txt (heading \"Text references\"
                       :property-drawer
                       '((\"REFUSE_TYPE\" . \"text\")
                         \"REFUSE_DATE\"
                         \"REFUSE_SOURCE\"
                         (\"PROPERTY_1\" . \"VALUE_1\")
                         (\"PROPERTY_2\" . my-function))))))

`:filter-bib-entries' property controls filtering of exported
BibTeX entries.  If the value of this property is non-nil and
TARGET is a BibTeX file, only the entries that are not already
present in this file will be exported.  The value can also be a
string or a list of strings specifying BibTeX file(s), or a
variable as an unquoted symbol holding a string or a list of
strings specifying BibTeX file(s), in which cases the entries
will be filtered also against this/these file(s) in *addition* to
the TARGET file.  In such instances, filtering will also be
applied to entries exported to an Org-mode heading.

Example:
\(setq refuse-export-options
      '((bib (path \"references.bib\" :filter-bib-entries t
             (heading \"BibTeX references\"
                       :filter-bib-entries bibtex-completion-bibliography))))."
